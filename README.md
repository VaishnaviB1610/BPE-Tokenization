# BPE-Tokenization
# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenization Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** algorithm for tokenization. The BPE algorithm is trained on the NLTK Gutenberg Corpus, and its performance is evaluated against the standard **NLTK word_tokenize** method. 

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit (for text processing)
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing results
- `numpy`: For numerical operations

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib numpy
